# Recipe App With React Native
This project is a simple recipe application that I developed to gain experience in the Web API while learning React Native. 

## Features

- You can view many different meal categories. 
- When you tap categories cards, the app shows you a variety of meals in that category. 
- You can see the recipe of that meal and which country's cuisine it belongs to by tapping on the meal cards. 
- When looking at the recipe of the meal, you can watch the video of that meal on Youtube, if any. When you tap the button, the app will direct you to Youtube.
